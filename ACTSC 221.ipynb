    "\n",
    "Notation $i^{(m)}$ to mean a **nominal**, or **stated annual rate** compounded $m$ times per year.  \n",
    "Ex. $i^{(2)} = 10\\%$ means the nominal rate is 10%, compound semi-annually.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, $\\$1$ invested at $i^{(m)}$ will receive interest at a rate of $\\frac{i^{(m)}}{m}$, $m$ times per year (received at the end of each $\\frac{1}{m^{\\text{th}}}$ of a year.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, an initial principal, $P$, will accumulate to a final value, $A$, when invested at $i^{(m)}$ for $n$ periods to\n",

    "### Equivalent Rates\n",

    "Suppose we have $i^{(4)} = 10\\%$, then to find the equivalent annual rate of interest $i^{(1)}$, we solve for\n",
    "$$\\left(1 + \\frac{i^{(4)}}{4}\\right)^{4} = \\left(1 + \\frac{10\\%}{4}\\right)^{4} = 1 + i^{(1)}$$\n",
    "So we have $i^{(1)} = 10.381289\\%$.\n",

    "This annually compounded rate that is equivalent to the given nominal rate is called the **effective annual rate** (**EAR**).\n",

    "## Varying Rates\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose $\\$200$ in invested in an account that pays $i^{(1)}=5\\%$, for the first 2 years, followed by $i^{(1)}=8\\%$ for the next 3 years...  \n",
    "By splitting this, $A(2)$ is computed by\n",
    "$$A(2) = 200(1+0.05)^{2}$$\n",
    "And that $A(5)$ is thus computed by\n",
