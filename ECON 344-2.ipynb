    "What is the difference between internal and external screening and evaluation approaches used by a firm in the new-product process?\n",

    "> Internal approach means the firm evaluates the technical feasibility of the proposal and whether the idea meets the objectives defined in the new-product strategy development step.  \n",
    "> This is all done \"in house\".\n",
    ">\n",
    "> External evaluations of concept tests consist of preliminary testing of the new-product idea (rather than the actual product) with consumers.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a test market?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Market testing is the exposing of actual products to prospective consumers under realistic purchase conditions to see if they will buy."
