    "## What is security\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of computers, usually means:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **C**confidentiality\n",
    "    * Access to systems or data is limited to authorized parties\n",
    "2. **I**ntegrity\n",
    "    * Receive the \"right\" data\n",
    "3. **A**vailability\n",
    "    * System or data is there when needed\n",
    "\n",
    "A computing system is _usually_ said to be secure if it has all three properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security and reliability\n",
    "\n",
    "Security goes hand in hand with \"reliability.\"  \n",
    "A secure system can be relied on to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Keep personal data confidential\n",
    "2. Allow only authorized access or modifications to resources\n",
    "3. Ensrue that any prouced results are correct\n",
    "4. Give correct and meaningful results _on demand_\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is privacy\n",
    "\n",
    "A useful definition of privacy: \"informational self-determination\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* _user_ gets to _control_ information _about ther user_\n",
    "* \"Control\" means:\n",
    "    * Who gets to see it\n",
    "    * Who gets to use it\n",
    "    * What they can use it for\n",
    "    * Who they can give it to\n",
    "    * etc\n",
    "\n",
    "### PIPEDA\n",
    "\n",
    "Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act.  \n",
    "Canada's private-sector privacy legislation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ten Fair Information Principles companies need to abide by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify the purpose of data collection\n",
    "2. Obtain consent\n",
    "3. Limit collection\n",
    "4. Limit use, disclosure and retention\n",
    "5. Use appropriate safeguards\n",
    "6. Give individuals access\n",
    "7. Be accurate\n",
    "8. Be open\n",
    "9. Be accountable\n",
    "10. Provide recourse\n",
    "\n",
    "## Security vs. privacy\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes people places security and privacy as if they're opposing forces.  \n",
    "Are thye really? Do we have to give up one to get the other?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Who are the adversaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Who's trying to mess with us?  \n",
    "Various groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Murphy\n",
    "* Amateurs\n",
    "* \"Script kiddies\"\n",
    "* Crackers\n",
    "* Organised crime\n",
    "* Government \"cyberwarriors\"\n",
    "* Terrorists\n",
    "\n",
    "## Terminologies\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assets\n",
    "\n",
    "Things we might want to protect, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Hardware\n",
    "* Software\n",
    "* Data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vulnerabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses in a system that may be able to be **exploited** in order to cause loss or harm\n",
    "\n",
    "### Threats\n",
    "\n",
    "A loss or harm that might befall a system\n",
    "\n",
    "Four major categories of threats:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Interception\n",
    "2. Interruption\n",
    "3. Modification\n",
    "4. Fabrication\n",
    "\n",
    "When designing a system, we need to state the **threat model**,\n",
    "\n",
    "* Set of threats we are undertaking to defend against\n",
    "* **Whom** do we want to prevent from doing **what**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Attack\n",
    "\n",
    "An action which **exploits** a **vulnerability** to **execute** a **threat**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Control/Defence\n",
    "\n",
    "Removing or reducing a vulnerability.  \n",
    "You **control** a **vulnerability** to prevent an **attack** and defense against a **threat**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods of defence\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Prevent it**: prevent the attack*\n",
    "* **Deter it**: make the attack harder or more expensive\n",
    "* **Deflect it**: make yourself less attractive to attacker\n",
    "* **Detect it**: notice that attack is occurring (or has occurred)\n",
    "* **Recover from it**: mitigate the effects of the attack\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, we'll want to do many things to defend against the same threat: \"**Defense in depth**\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## How secure should we make it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Principle of Easiest Penetration\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"A system is only as strong as its weakest link\"\n",
    "* The attacker will go after whatever part of the system is easiest for attacker, not most convenient for defender\n",
    "* In order to build secure systems, we need to **learn how to think like an attacker**\n",
    "\n",
    "Principle of Adequate Protection\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"Security is economics\"\n",
    "* Don't spent a lot of money to protect a system that can only cause a little damage\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defence of computer systems\n",
    "\n",
    "We may want to protect any of our **assets**: hardware, software, data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many ways to achieve this (not exhaustive).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Passowrds and other forms of access control.  \n",
    "Operating systems separate users' actions from each other.  \n",
    "Virus scanners watch for some kinds of malware.  \n",
    "Development controls enforce quality measures on the original source code.  \n",
    "Personal firewalls that run on your desktop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hardware controls\n",
    "\n",
    "Not usually protection of the hardware itself, but rather using separate hardware to protect the system as a whole.  \n",
    "Fingerprint readers.  \n",
    "Smart totkens.  \n",
    "Firewalls.  \n",
    "Intrusion detection systems.\n",
    "\n",
