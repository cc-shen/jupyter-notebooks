    "## What is security\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of computers, usually means:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **C**confidentiality\n",
    "    * Access to systems or data is limited to authorized parties\n",
    "2. **I**ntegrity\n",
    "    * Receive the \"right\" data\n",
    "3. **A**vailability\n",
    "    * System or data is there when needed\n",
    "\n",
    "A computing system is _usually_ said to be secure if it has all three properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security and reliability\n",
    "\n",
    "Security goes hand in hand with \"reliability.\"  \n",
    "A secure system can be relied on to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Keep personal data confidential\n",
    "2. Allow only authorized access or modifications to resources\n",
    "3. Ensrue that any prouced results are correct\n",
    "4. Give correct and meaningful results _on demand_\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is privacy\n",
    "\n",
    "A useful definition of privacy: \"informational self-determination\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* _user_ gets to _control_ information _about ther user_\n",
    "* \"Control\" means:\n",
    "    * Who gets to see it\n",
    "    * Who gets to use it\n",
    "    * What they can use it for\n",
    "    * Who they can give it to\n",

    "## Security vs. privacy\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes people places security and privacy as if they're opposing forces.  \n",
    "Are thye really? Do we have to give up one to get the other?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Who are the adversaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Who's trying to mess with us?  \n",
    "Various groups:\n",

    "* **Deter it**: make the attack harder or more expensive\n",
    "* **Deflect it**: make yourself less attractive to attacker\n",
    "* **Detect it**: notice that attack is occurring (or has occurred)\n",
    "* **Recover from it**: mitigate the effects of the attack\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, we'll want to do many things to defend against the same threat: \"**Defense in depth**\"\n",

    "\n",
    "## Secure programs\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is it so hard to write secure programs?  \n",
    "A simple answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Axiom (Murphy): programs have bugs\n",
    "* Corollary: security-relevant programs have security bugs\n",
    "\n",
    "## Flaw, faults, and failures\n",
    "\n",
    "A **flaw** is a problem in a program.  \n",
    "A **security flaw** is a problem that affects security in some way; confidentiality, integrity, and availability.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Flaws come in two types: **faults** and **failures**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **fault** is a mistake, \"behind the scenes\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* An error in the code, data, specification, process, etc.\n",
    "* A fault is a **potential problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **failure** is when something _actually_ goes wrong\n",
    "\n",
    "* You log in to the library’s web site, and it shows you someone else’s account\n",
    "* \"Goes wrong\" means a deviation from the desired behaviour, not necessarily from the specified behaviour!\n",
    "    * The specification itself may be wrong\n",
    "\n",
    "A fault is the programmer/specifier/inside view.  \n",
    "A failure is the user/outside view.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding and fixing faults\n",
    "\n",
    "How do you find a fault?\n",
    "\n",
    "* If a user experiences a failure, you can try to work backwards to uncover the underlying fault\n",
    "* What about faults that haven't (yet) led to failures?\n",
    "* Intentionally try to _cause_ failures, then proceed as above\n",
    "    * Think like an attacker!\n",
    "\n",
    "Fixing faults:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Usually by making small edits (**patches**) to the program; this process is \"penetrate and patch\"\n",
    "* ex. Microsoft's \"Patch Tuesday\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problems with patching\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes patching makes things _worse_!\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pressure to patch a fault is often high, causing a narrow focus on the observed failure, instead of a broad look at what may be a more serious underlying problem\n",
    "* The fault may have caused other, unnoticed failures, and a partial fix may cause inconsistencies or other problem\n",
    "* The patch for this fault may be introducing new faults\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatives to patching?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Very difficult... How can programmers inform the users in the best way possible to avoid exposing the fault\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unexpected behaviour\n",
    "\n",
    "When a behaviour is specified, the spec usually lists the things the program must do; e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `ls` must list the names of the files in the directory whose name is given, if the user has permissions to read that directory\n",
    "\n",
    "Most implementors wouldn't care if it did additional things as well\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sorting the list alphabetically before outputting them is fine\n",
    "\n",
    "But from a security/privacy point of view, extra behaviour could be bad\n",
    "\n",
    "* After displaying the filenames, post the list to a public web site\n",
    "* After displaying the filenames, delete the files\n",
    "\n",
    "When implementing a security or privacy relevant program, you should consider \"and nothing else\" to be implicitly added to the spec\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"should do\" vs. \"shouldn't do\"\n",
    "* Testing for \"shouldn't do\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of security flaws\n",
    "\n",
    "A way to divide up security flaws is be genesis (where they came from).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some flaws are **intentional**/**inherent**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Malicious** flaws are intentionally inserted to attack systems, either in general, or certain systems in particular\n",
    "    * If it's meant to attack some particular system, we call it a targeted malicious flaw\n",
    "    * Otherwise, it's a general flaw\n",
    "* **Nonmalicious** (but intentional or inherent) flaws are often features that are meant to the be in the system, and are correctly implemented, but nonetheless can cause a failure when used by an attacker\n",
    "\n",
    "Most security flaws are caused by **unintentional** program errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unintentional security flaw\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Heartbleed bug in OpenSSL (April 2014)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **TLS Heartbeat mechanism** is designed to keep SSL/TLS connections alive even when no data is being transmitted.  \n",
    "Heartbeat messages sent by one peer contain random data and a payload length.  \n",
    "The other peer is suppose to respond with a mirror of exactly the same data.\n",
    "\n",
    "User $\\rightarrow$ server:  \n",
    "`Type | Length | Payload`  \n",
    "e.g. `HB_RQST | 64KB | H`\n",
    "\n",
    "Relevant [xkcd](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/heartbleed_explanation.png).\n",
    "\n",
    "There was a **missing bounds check**!  \n",
    "An attacker can request that a TLS server hand over a relatively large slice (up to 64KB) of its private memory space.  \n",
    "This is the _same_ memory space where OpenSSL also stores the server's private key material as well as TLS session keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Apple's SSL/TLS bug (February 2014)\n",
    "\n",
    "The bug occurs in the code used to check the validity of the server's signature on a key used in an SSL/TLS connection.  \n",
    "Bug existed in certain versions of OSX 10.9 and iOS 6.1 and 7.0.  \n",
    "An attacker (\"man in the middle\") could potentially exploit the flaw to get a user to accept a counterfeit key chosen by the attacker.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Buggy Code\n",
    "\n",
    "```swift\n",
    "static OSStatus\n",
    "SSLVerifySignedServerKeyExchange(SSLContext *ctx, bool isRsa, SSLBuffer signedParams,\n",
    "                                 uint8_t *signature, UInt16 signatureLen)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    OSStatus        err;\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "\n",
    "    if ((err = SSLHashSHA1.update(&hashCtx, &serverRandom)) != 0)\n",
    "        goto fail;\n",
    "    if ((err = SSLHashSHA1.update(&hashCtx, &signedParams)) != 0)\n",
    "        goto fail;\n",
    "        goto fail;\n",
    "    if ((err = SSLHashSHA1.final(&hashCtx, &hashOut)) != 0)\n",
    "        goto fail;\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "\n",
    "fail:\n",
    "    SSLFreeBuffer(&signedHashes);\n",
    "    SSLFreeBuffer(&hashCtx);\n",
    "    return err;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The are two consecutive `goto fail` statements!  \n",
    "The second `goto fail` statement is always executed _if_ the first two checks succeeded.  \n",
    "In this case, the third check is bypassed and $0$ is returned as the value of `err`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of unintentional flaws\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Buffer overflows\n",
    "\n",
    "Most commonly exploited type of security flaw.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upshot: if the attacker can write data past the end of an array on the stack, attacker can _usually_ overwrite things like the saved return address.  \n",
    "When the function returns, it will jump to any address of the attacker's choosing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Targets: programs on a local machine that run with setuid (superuser) privileges, or a network daemons on a remote machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Kinds of buffer overflows\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the classic attack which overflows a buffer on the stack to jump to shellcode, there are many variants:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Attack which work when a **single byte** can be written past the end of the buffer (often caused by a common off-by-one error)\n",
    "* Overflows or buffers on the heap instead of the stack\n",
    "* Jump to other parts of the program, or parts of standard libraries, instead of shellcode\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Defences against buffer overflows\n",
    "\n",
    "Programmer: use a language with bounds checking\n",
    "\n",
    "* Also catch those exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "Compiler: place padding between data and return address (\"canaries\")\n",
    "\n",
    "* Detect if the stack has been overwritten before the return from each function\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory: non-executable stack\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"W$\\oplus$X\" (memory page is either writable or executable, but never both)\n",
    "\n",
    "OS: stack (and sometimes code, heap, libraries) at random virtual addresses for each process\n",
    "\n",
    "* All mainstream OSes do this\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Integer overflows\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine integers represents a finite set of numbers.  \n",
    "This may not correspond to a programmer's mental model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose Program assumes that integer is always positive, overflow will make (signed) integer wrap and become negative, which will violate assumption!\n",
    "\n",
    "* Program casts large unsigned integers to signed integer\n",
    "* Result of a mathematical operation causes overflow\n",
    "\n",
    "Attack can pass values to program that will trigger overflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Format string vulnerabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "Class of vulnerabilities discovered only in 2000.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfiltered user input is used as format string in `printf()`, `fprintf()`, `sprintf()`, ...  \n",
    "e.g. `printf(buffer)` instead of `printf(\"%s\", buffer)`\n",
    "\n",
    "* `printf(buffer)` will parse buffer for %'s and use whatever is currently on the stack to process found format parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "`printf(\"%s%s%s%s\")` likely crashes your program.  \n",
    "`printf(\"%x%x%x%x\")` dumps parts of the stack.  \n",
    "`%n` will **write** to an address found on the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example expansion code\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "char output [44];\n",
    "char buffer [44];\n",
    "\n",
    "snprintf(buffer, sizeof(buffer), \"Input %s\", input);\n",
    "sprintf(output, buffer);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens if input=%48d+(address of a libc routine)?\n",
