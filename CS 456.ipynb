    "## 1.1 What is the Internet\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.1 A Nuts-and-Bolts Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Devices connected to the Internet are **host** (equivalently, **end systems**).\n",
    "\n",
    "End systems are connected together via **communication links** and **packet switches**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Transmission rate** (or **bandwidth**), measured in bits/second, is the rate of data being transmitted over a link.  \n",
    "**Packets** are packages of information sent over a link.\n",
    "\n",
    "A _packet switch_ takes a _packet_ arriving on one of its incoming communication links and forward that packet on one of its outgoing communication links.  \n",
    "Two prominent packet switches are **routers** and **link-layer switches**.  \n",
    "_Link-layer switches_ are typically used in access networks, while _routers_ are typically used in the network core.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sequence of communication links and packet switches traversed by a packet from the sending end system to the receiving end system is known as a **route** or **path** through the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "End systems access the Internet through **Internet Service Providers** (**ISPs**).  \n",
    "The Internet is all about connecting end systems to each other, so the ISPs that provide access to end systems must also be interconnected.  \n",
    "Lower-tier ISPs are interconnected through national and international upper-tier ISPs.  \n",
    "An upper-tier ISP consists of high-speed routers interconnected with high-speed fiber-optic links.\n",
    "\n",
    "End systems, packet switches, and other pieces of the Internet run **protocols** that control the sending and receiving of information within the Internet.  \n",
    "Two most important protocols: **Transmission Control Protocol** (**TCP**) and the **Internet Protocol** (**IP**).  \n",
    "IP specifies the format of the packets.  \n",
    "The Internet’s principal protocols are collectively known as **TCP/IP**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Internet standards** are developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).  \n",
    "To ensure systems and products can inter-operate with each other.  \n",
    "The IETF standards documents are called **requests for comments** (**RFCs**).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.2 A Services Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Internet in another angle: _an infrastructure that provides services to applications_.  \n",
    "**Distributed applications**, applications that involve multiple end systems that exchange data with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "End systems attached to the Internet provide an **Application Programming Interface** (**API**) that specifies how a program running on one end system asks the Internet infrastructure to _deliver data_ to a _specific destination_ program running on another end system.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.3 What is a Protocol?\n",
    "\n",
    "> A **protocol** defines the _format_ and the _order_ of messages exchanged between two or more communicating entities, as well as the _actions taken_ on the transmission and/or receipt of a message or other event.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 The Network Edge\n",
    "\n",
    "Applications and end systems are at the _edge of the network_.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Host = end system._\n",
    "\n",
    "Hosts can be divided into two categories: **clients** and **servers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2.1 Access Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "_Access network_ -- the network that physically connects an end system to the first router (also known as _edge router_) on a path from the end system to any other distant end system.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Home Access: DSL, Cable, FTTH, Dial-up, and Satellite\n",
    "\n",
    "Two most prevalent types of broadband residential access are **digital subscriber line** (**DSL**) and cable.\n",
    "\n",
    "When DSL is used, a customer's telco is also its ISP.  \n",
    "Each customer's DSL modem uses the existing telephone line to exchange data with a **digital subscriber line access multiplexer** (**DSLAM**) located in the telco's local central office (CO).\n",
    "\n",
    "Residential telephone line carries both data and telephone signals simultaneously (asynchronous):\n",
    "\n",
    "* A high-speed downstream channel, in the 50 kHz to 1 MHz band\n",
    "* A medium-speed upstream channel, in the 4 kHz to 50 kHz band\n",
    "* An ordinary two-way telephone channel, in the 0 to 4 kHz band\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cable Internet access** utilizes cable television company's existing cable television infrastructure.  \n",
    "Fiber optics connect the cable head end to neighborhood-level junctions, from which traditional coaxial cable is then used to reach individual houses and apartments.  \n",
    "Both fiber and coaxial cable are employed in this system, it is often referred to as **hybrid fiber coax** (**HFC**).\n",
    "\n",
    "Cable Internet access requires a cable modem.  \n",
    "At the cable head end, the **cable modem termination system** (**CMTS**) serves a similar function as a DSLAM -- turning the analog signal sent from the cable modems in many downstream homes back into digital format.  \n",
    "Cable modems divide the HFC network into two channels, a downstream and an upstream channel, with asynchronous access.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important characteristic of cable Internet access is that it is a _shared broadcast medium_.  \n",
    "If several users are simultaneously using the downstream channel, the actual rate at which each user receives its content will be significantly lower than the aggregate cable downstream rate.  \n",
    "Because the upstream channel is also shared, a distributed multiple access protocol is needed to coordinate transmissions and avoid collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fiber to the home** (**FTTH**) provides even higher speed.  \n",
    "The FTTH concept is simple -- provide an optical fiber path from the CO directly to the home.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest optical distribution network is _direct fiber_, with one fiber leaving the CO for each home.  \n",
    "More commonly, each fiber leaving the central office is actually shared by many homes;\n",
    "it is not until the fiber gets relatively close to the homes that it is split into individual customer-specific fibers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two competing optical-distribution network architectures that perform splitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "* active optical networks (AONs) -- essentially switched Ethernet\n",
    "* passive optical networks (PONs)\n",
    "\n",
    "In a PON, each home has an **optical network terminator** (**ONT**), which is connected by dedicated optical fiber to a neighbourhood splitter.  \n",
    "Splitter connects to an **optical line terminator** (**OLT**) in the telco's CO.  \n",
    "In the PON architecture, all packets sent from OLT to the splitter are replicated at the splitter.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In locations where DSL, cable, and FTTH are not available, a satellite link can be used to connect a residence to the Internet at speeds of more than 1 Mbps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dial-up access over traditional phone lines is based on the same model as DSL -- a home modem connects over a phone line to a modem in the ISP.  \n",
    "Dial-up access is excruciatingly slow at 56 kbps.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Access in the Enterprise (and the Home): Ethernet and WiFi\n",
    "\n",
    "Wireless LAN access based on IEEE 802.11 technology, more colloquially known as WiFi, is now just about everywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Wide-Area Wireless Access: 3G and LTE\n",
    "\n",
    "3G -- third-generation wireless\n",
    "\n",
    "LTE -- Long-term Evolution\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2.2 Physical Media\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bit**: propagates between transmitter/receiver pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Physical link**: what lies between transmitter & receiver.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each transmitter-receiver pair, the bit is sent by propagating electromagnetic waves or optical pulses across a **physical medium**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Physical media fall into two categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **guided media**: the waves are guided along a solid medium         \n",
    "* **unguided media**: the waves propagate in the atmosphere and in outer space\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Twisted-Pair Copper Wire\n",
    "\n",
    "Least expensive and most commonly used guided transmission medium.  \n",
    "Two insulated copper wires\n",
    "\n",
    "* Category 5: 100 Mbps, 1 Gbps Ethernet\n",
    "* Category 6: 10 Gbps\n",
    "\n",
    "A Wire pair constitutes as a single communication link.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unshielded twisted pair** (**UTP**) is commonly used for computer networks within a building.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Coaxial Cable\n",
    "\n",
    "Two concentric copper conductors.  \n",
    "Bidirectional.  \n",
    "Can be used as a guided **shared medium**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple channels on cable; HFC.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fiber Optics\n",
    "\n",
    "Glass fiber carrying light pulses, each pulse represents a bit.  \n",
    "High-speed operation, high-speed point-to-point transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "Low error rate:\n",
    "\n",
    "* repeaters spaced far apart\n",
    "* immune to electromagnetic noise\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Terrestrial Radio Channels\n",
    "\n",
    "Bidirectional.\n",
    "\n",
    "Radio channels carry signals in the electromagnetic spectrum.  \n",
    "No installation of physical wires, can penetrate walls, provide connectivity to a mobile user, and can potentially carry a signal for long distances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Propagation environment effects:\n",
    "\n",
    "* reflection\n",
    "* obstruction by objects\n",
    "* interference\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Satellite Radio Channels\n",
    "\n",
    "A communication satellite links two or more Earth-based microwave transmitter/receivers, known as ground stations.  \n",
    "Satellite receives transmission on one frequency band, regenerates the signal using a repeated, and transmits the signal on another frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two types of satellites used:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **geostationary satellites**\n",
    "    * permanently remain above the same spot on Earth\n",
    "    * end-to-end delay of 280 ms\n",
    "* **low-earth orbiting** (**LEO**) **satellites**\n",
    "    * rotate around Earth and may communicate with each other\n",
    "    * many satellites required to continuously provide coverage to an area\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 The Network Core\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3.1 Packet Switching\n",
    "\n",
    "Long messages are broken into smaller chunks of data known as **packets**, of length $L$.  \n",
    "Each packet travels through communication links and **packet switches** from source to destination.  \n",
    "Packets are transmitted over each communication link at a rate equal to the _full_ transmission rate of the link, at rate $R$ bits/s.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{packet transmission delay} = \\text{time needed to transmit L-bit packet into link} = \\frac{L\\text{ (bits)}}{R\\text{(bits/sec)}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Link transmission rate = link **capacity** = **link bandwidth**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Store-and-Forward Transmission\n",
    "\n",
    "The packet switch must receive the _entire_ packet before it can begin to transmit the first bit of the packet onto the outbound link.\n",
    "\n",
    "End-to-end delay of $N$ links each of rate $R$ is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ d_{\\text{end-to-end}} = N \\frac{L}{R}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Queuing Delays and Packet Loss\n",
    "\n",
    "If an arriving packet needs to be transmitted onto a link but the link is busy with the transmission of another packet, the arriving packet suffers **output buffer**'s **queuing delays**.  \n",
    "Since output buffer is finite in space, **packet loss** will occur -- either the arriving packet or one of the already-queued packets will be dropped.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Forwarding Tables and Routing Protocols\n",
    "\n",
    "When a source end system sends a packet to a destination end system, it includes the destination's IP address in the packet's header.  \n",
    "The router examines a portion of the packet's destination address and forwards the packet to an adjacent router.  \n",
    "Each router has a **forwarding table** that maps destination addresses (or portions of the destination addresses) to that router's outbound links.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Internet has a number of special **routing protocols** that are used to automatically set the forwarding tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3.2 Circuit Switching\n",
    "\n",
    "An _alternate_ approach to moving data through a network of links and switches.  \n",
    "Commonly used in traditional telephone networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "End-to-end resources along a path (buffers, link transmission rate) reserved for the duration of the communication session between the end systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the sender can send the information, the network must establish a connection between the sender and the receiver.  \n",
    "This is a _bona fide_ connection for which the switches along the path maintain connection state for that connection.  \n",
    "This connection is called a **circuit**.  \n",
    "Circuit segment idle if not used, i.e. no sharing.\n",
    "\n",
    "A constant transmission rate is reserved, such that the data transfers at the _guaranteed_ constant rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multiplexing in Circuit-Switched Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "A circuit in a link is implemented in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **frequency-division multiplexing** (**FDM**)\n",
    "    * a frequency band is dedicated for the duration of the connection\n",
    "    * the width of the band is called **bandwidth**\n",
    "* **time-division multiplexing** (**TDM**)\n",
    "    * time is divided into frames of fixed duration, and each frame is divided into a fixed number of time slots\n",
    "    * each circuit gets all of the bandwidth periodically during brief intervals of time\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Packet Switching Vs. Circuit Switching\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros of packet switching:\n",
    "\n",
    "* offers better sharing of transmission capacity\n",
    "* simpler, more efficient, and less costly to implement\n",
    "* great for burst-y data\n",
    "    * resource sharing\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons of packet switching:\n",
    "\n",
    "* not suitable for real-time services\n",
    "* excessive congestion possible: packet delay and loss\n",
    "    * protocols needed for reliable data transfer, congestion control\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3.3 A Network of Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Review slides 33 +\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.4 Delay, Loss, and Throughput in Packet-Switched Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Packet _queue_ in router buffers, packet arrival rate to link (temporarily) exceeds output link capacity.  \n",
    "PAckets queue, wait for turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4.1 Overview of Delay in Packet-Switched Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "A packet can suffer from several types of delays at _each_ node along the path.  \n",
    "The most important delays are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **nodal processing delay**, $d_{\\text{proc}}$\n",
    "    * examine the packet's header and determine output link\n",
    "    * check for bit-level errors in the packet during receiving\n",
    "    * typically on the order of microseconds or less\n",
    "* **queuing delay**, $d_{\\text{queue}}$\n",
    "    * time waiting at output link for transmission\n",
    "    * depends on congestion level of router, typically order of microseconds to milliseconds\n",
    "* **transmission delay**, $d_{\\text{trans}}$\n",
    "    * amount of time to push all of the packet's bits into the link\n",
    "    * $L$: _packet length_ in bits\n",
    "    * $R$: _link bandwidth_ in bps\n",
    "    * $\\frac{L}{R}$\n",
    "    * typically order of microseconds to milliseconds\n",
    "* **propagation delay**, $d_{\\text{prop}}$\n",
    "    * time needed to _physically_ propagate from one node to another node\n",
    "    * $d$: _length of physical link_\n",
    "    * $s$: propagation speed (in the range from $2 \\cdot 10^{8}$ m/s to $3 \\cdot 10^{8}$ m/s)\n",
    "    * $\\frac{d}{s}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Combined, they accumulate to **total nodal delay**, $d_{\\text{nodal}}$,\n",
    "$$d_{\\text{nodal}} = d_{\\text{proc}} + d_{\\text{queue}} + d_{\\text{trans}} + d_{\\text{prop}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4.2 Queuing Delay and Packet Loss\n",
    "\n",
    "$R$: link bandwidth (bps)  \n",
    "$L$: packet length (bits)  \n",
    "$a$: _average_ packet arrival rate\n",
    "\n",
    "The average rate at which bits arrive at the queue is $La$ bits/sec.  \n",
    "The ratio $\\frac{La}{R}$, called **traffic intensity**, plays an important role in estimating the extent of the queuing delay.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $\\frac{La}{R} > 1$, the queuing delay will approach infinity!  \n",
    "More bits arrive into the queue than the bits can be transmitted from the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $\\frac{La}{R} \\sim{>} 1$, average queuing delay large.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $\\frac{La}{R} \\sim 0$, average queuing delay small.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Packet Loss\n",
    "\n",
    "Queue capacity is finite, packet delays do not approach infinity as the traffic intensity approaches 1.  \n",
    "Instead, a router will **drop** the packet, resulting in a **packet loss**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fraction of lost packets increases as the traffic intensity increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lost packet _may_ be retransmitted by previous node, by source end system, or not at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4.3 End-to-End Delay\n",

    "* router $i$ will return packets to sender\n",
    "* sender times the interval between transmission and reply\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4.4 Throughput in Computer Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "**throughput**: rate (bits/time unit) at which bits transferred between sender/receiver\n",
    "\n",
    "* **instantaneous**: rate at a given point in time\n",
    "* **average**: rate over longer period of time\n",
    "\n",
    "The node with the lowest throughput is the **bottleneck link**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.5 Protocol Layers and Their Service Models\n",
    "\n",
    "The Internet is a complicated system with many pieces: hosts, routers, links of various media, applications, protocols, hardware, and software.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.5.1 Layered Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "A layered architecture allows us to discuss a well-defined, specific part of a large and complex system.  \n",
    "Modularization eases maintenance, updating of system (change of implementation of layer's service transparent to rest of system).\n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to change the implementation of a service without affecting other components of the system is another important advantage of layering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each layer implements a service (provide to the layer above) via its own internal-layer actions, while relying on services provided by layer below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Protocol Layering\n",
    "\n",
    "Each protocol belongs to one of the layers.  \n",
    "Interested in the **services** that a layer offers to the layer above -- the so-called **service model** of a layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "A protocol layer can be implemented in software, in hardware, or both.\n",
    "\n",
    "Application-layer protocols are almost always implemented in software in the end systems; so are transport-layer protocols.\n",
    "\n",
    "When taken together, the protocols of the various layers are called the **protocol stack**.\n",

    "Steps of attack:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select target\n",
    "2. Break into hosts around the network\n",

    "\n",
    "In a DDoS attack, the attacker controls multiple sources and has each source blast traffic at the target.\n",

    "Most DoS attacks fall into one of three categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "* _Vulnerability attack_\n",
    "    * exploits vulnerable applications\n",
    "* _Bandwidth flooding_\n",
    "    * prevent legitimate packets from reaching the server\n",
