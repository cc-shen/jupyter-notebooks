    "\n",
    "## 1.1 What is the Internet\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.1 A Nuts-and-Bolts Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Devices connected to the Internet are **host** (equivalently, **end systems**).\n",
    "\n",
    "End systems are connected together via **communication links** and **packet switches**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Transmission rate** (or **bandwidth**), measured in bits/second, is the rate of data being transmitted over a link.  \n",
    "**Packets** are packages of information sent over a link.\n",
    "\n",
    "A _packet switch_ takes a _packet_ arriving on one of its incoming communication links and forward that packet on one of its outgoing communication links.  \n",
    "Two prominent packet switches are **routers** and **link-layer switches**.  \n",
    "_Link-layer switches_ are typically used in access networks, while _routers_ are typically used in the network core.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sequence of communication links and packet switches traversed by a packet from the sending end system to the receiving end system is known as a **route** or **path** through the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "End systems access the Internet through **Internet Service Providers** (**ISPs**).  \n",
    "The Internet is all about connecting end systems to each other, so the ISPs that provide access to end systems must also be interconnected.  \n",
    "Lower-tier ISPs are interconnected through national and international upper-tier ISPs.  \n",
    "An upper-tier ISP consists of high-speed routers interconnected with high-speed fiber-optic links.\n",
    "\n",
    "End systems, packet switches, and other pieces of the Internet run **protocols** that control the sending and receiving of information within the Internet.  \n",
    "Two most important protocols: **Transmission Control Protocol** (**TCP**) and the **Internet Protocol** (**IP**).  \n",
    "IP specifies the format of the packets.  \n",
    "The Internetâ€™s principal protocols are collectively known as **TCP/IP**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Internet standards** are developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).  \n",
    "To ensure systems and products can inter-operate with each other.  \n",
    "The IETF standards documents are called **requests for comments** (**RFCs**).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.2 A Services Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Internet in another angle: _an infrastructure that provides services to applications_.  \n",
    "**Distributed applications**, applications that involve multiple end systems that exchange data with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "End systems attached to the Internet provide an **Application Programming Interface** (**API**) that specifies how a program running on one end system asks the Internet infrastructure to _deliver data_ to a _specific destination_ program running on another end system.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.3 What is a Protocol?\n",
    "\n",
    "> A **protocol** defines the _format_ and the _order_ of messages exchanged between two or more communicating entities, as well as the _actions taken_ on the transmission and/or receipt of a message or other event.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 The Network Edge\n",
    "\n",
    "Applications and end systems are at the _edge of the network_.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Host = end system._\n",
    "\n",
    "Hosts can be divided into two categories: **clients** and **servers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2.1 Access Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "_Access network_-- the network that physically connects an end system to the first router (also known as _edge router_) on a path from the end system to any other distant end system.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Home Access: DSL, Cable, FTTH, Dial-up, and Satellite\n",
    "\n",
    "Two most prevalent types of broadband residential access are **digital subscriber line** (**DSL**) and cable.\n",
    "\n",
    "When DSL is used, a customer's telco is also its ISP.  \n",
    "Each customer's DSL modem uses the existing telephone line to exchange data with a _digital subscriber line access multiplexer_ (DSLAM) located in the telco's local central office (CO).\n",
    "\n",
    "Residential telephone line carries both data and telephone signals simultaneously (asynchronous):\n",
    "\n",
    "* A high-speed downstream channel, in the 50 kHz to 1 MHz band\n",
    "* A medium-speed upstream channel, in the 4 kHz to 50 kHz band\n",
    "* An ordinary two-way telephone channel, in the 0 to 4 kHz band\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cable Internet access** utilizes cable television company's existing cable television infrastructure.  \n",
    "Fiber optics connect the cable head end to neighborhood-level junctions, from which tradi- tional coaxial cable is then used to reach individual houses and apartments.  \n",
    "Both fiber and coaxial cable are employed in this system, it is often referred to as _hybrid fiber coax_ (HFC).\n",
    "\n",
    "Cable Internet access requires a cable modem.  \n",
    "At the cable head end, the _cable modem termination system_ (CMTS) serves a similar function as a DSLAM -- turning the analog signal sent from the cable modems in many downstream homes back into digital format.  \n",
    "Cable modems divide the HFC network into two channels, a downstream and an upstream channel, with asynchronous access.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important characteristic of cable Internet access is that it is a _shared broadcast medium_.  \n",
    "If several users are simultaneously using the downstream channel, the actual rate at which each user receives its content will be significantly lower than the aggregate cable downstream rate.  \n",
    "Because the upstream channel is also shared, a distributed multiple access protocol is needed to coordinate transmissions and avoid collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fiber to the home** (**FTTH**) provides even higher speed.  \n",
    "The FTTH concept is simple -- provide an optical fiber path from the CO directly to the home.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest optical distribution network is _direct fiber_, with one fiber leaving the CO for each home.  \n",
    "More commonly, each fiber leaving the central office is actually shared by many homes;\n",
    "it is not until the fiber gets relatively close to the homes that it is split into individual customer-specific fibers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two competing optical-distribution network architectures that perform splitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "* active optical networks (AONs) -- essentially switched Ethernet\n",
    "* passive optical networks (PONs)\n",
    "\n",
    "In a PON, each home has an _optical network terminator_ (ONT), which is connected by dedicated optical fiber to a neighbourhood splitter.  \n",
    "Splitter connects to an _optical line terminator_ (OLT) in the telco's CO.  \n",
    "In the PON architecture, all packets sent from OLT to the splitter are replicated at the splitter.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In locations where DSL, cable, and FTTH are not available, a satellite link can be used to connect a residence to the Internet at speeds of more than 1 Mbps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dial-up access over traditional phone lines is based on the same model as DSL -- a home modem connects over a phone line to a modem in the ISP.  \n",
    "Dial-up access is excruciatingly slow at 56 kbps.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Access in the Enterprise (and the Home): Ethernet and WiFi\n",
    "\n",
    "Wireless LAN access based on IEEE 802.11 technology, more colloquially known as WiFi, is now just about everywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Wide-Area Wireless Access: 3G and LTE\n",
    "\n",
    "3G -- third-generation wireless\n",
    "\n",
    "LTE -- Long-term Evolution\n",
