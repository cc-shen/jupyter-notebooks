    "\n",
    "The sequence of communication links and packet switches traversed by a packet from the sending end system to the receiving end system is known as a **route** or **path** through the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "End systems access the Internet through **Internet Service Providers** (**ISPs**).  \n",

    "An upper-tier ISP consists of high-speed routers interconnected with high-speed fiber-optic links.\n",

    "End systems, packet switches, and other pieces of the Internet run **protocols** that control the sending and receiving of information within the Internet.  \n",

    "**Internet standards** are developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).  \n",

    "Core of network app. dev. is writing programs that run on _different_ end systems that communicate over the network.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2.1.1 Network Application Architectures\n",
    "\n",
    "Network architecture is fixed and provides a specific set of services to applications.  \n",
    "The **application architecture** is designed by the application developer and dictates how the application is structured over the various end systems.  \n",
    "Two predominant architectural paradigms:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Client-server\n",
    "    * server\n",
    "        * always-on\n",
    "        * permanent IP address\n",
    "        * data centers for scaling\n",

    "        * may have dynamic IP addresses\n",
    "        * do not communicate directly with each other\n",
    "* Peer-to-peer (P2P)\n",
    "    * no always-on server\n",
    "    * arbitrary end systems directly communicate\n",
    "    * peers request service from other peers, provide service in return to other peers\n",
    "        * self-scalability -- new peers bring new server capacity, as well as new service demands\n",
    "    * peers are intermittently connected and change IP addresses\n",
    "        * complex management\n",
    "    * three major challenges\n",
    "        1. ISP Friendly. Residential ISPs bandwidth has more downstream than upstream, thus distributing content can put stress on the ISPs\n",
    "        2. Security\n",
    "        3. Incentives. Success depends on convincing users to volunteer bandwidth, storage, and computation resources to the applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1.2 Process Communicating\n",
    "\n",
    "**Process**: program running within a host\n",
    "\n",
    "* within same host, two processes communicate using **inter-process communication** (defined by OS)\n",
    "* processes in different hosts communicate by exchanging **messages**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Client and Server Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Client process**: process that initiates communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Server process**: process that waits to be contacted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside: applications with P2P architectures have client processes & server processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Interface Between the Process and the Computer Network\n",

    "\n",
    "![socket diagram](Assets/network-2.3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Addressing Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "Process must have **identifier** to receive messages.  \n",
    "Host device has unique 32-bit IP address.  \n",

    "### 2.1.3 Transport Services Available to Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "A socket is the interface between the application process and the transport-layer protocol.  \n",
    "The app. pushes messages through the socket;\n",
    "the transport-layer protocol has the responsibility of getting the messages tot he socket of the receiving process.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the services that a transport-layer protocol can offer to applications?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reliable Data Transfer\n",
    "\n",
    "i.e. Data integrity\n",
    "\n",
    "If a protocol provides a guaranteed data delivery service (i.e. data is delivered correctly and completely), it is said to provide **reliable data transfer**.  \n",
    "Some apps _require_ 100% reliable data transfer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another potential service is process-to-process reliable data transfer.\n",
    "\n",
    "If reliable data transfer not provided, this may be acceptable for **loss-tolerant applications*.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Throughput\n",
    "\n",
    "Apps with throughput requirements are said to be **bandwidth-sensitive applications**.  \n",
    "e.g., multimedia applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Elastic applications** can make use of as much, or as little, throughput as happens to be available; although more throughput is always better.  \n",
    "e.g., email, file transfer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Timing\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-time applications require tight timing constraints on data delivery in order to be effective.  \n",
    "e.g., virtual environments, interactive games.\n",
    "\n",
    "For non-real-time applications, no tight constraints on end-to-end delays (but lower delay is better).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Security\n",
    "\n",
    "Transfer protocol can encrypt all data transmitted by the sending process, and in the receiving host, the protocol can decrypt the data before delivering them to the receiving process.  \n",
    "i.e. provides confidentiality.\n",
    "\n",
    "A transport protocol can also provide services such as data integrity and end-point authentication.\n",

    "    * requests, receives (using HTTP) and displays Web objects\n",
    "* Server\n",
    "    * sends (using HTTP) objects in response to requests\n",
    "\n",
    "Uses _TCP_:\n",
    "\n",
    "* client initiates TCP connection (creates socket) to server, default port 80\n",
    "* server accepts TCP connection from client\n",
    "* HTTP messages exchanged between browser and web server\n",
    "* TCP connection closed\n",
    "\n",
    "HTTP is a **stateless** protocol.  \n",
    "Server maintains no info about past client requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Protocols that maintain \"state\" are complex!\n",
    "\n",
    "* Past history (state) must be maintained\n",
    "* If server/client crashes, their views of \"state\" may be inconsistent, must be reconciled\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2.2 Non-Persistent and Persistent Connections\n",
    "\n",
    "HTTP uses persistent connections by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### HTTP with Non-Persistent Connections\n",
    "\n",
    "Each TCP connection is closed after the server sends the object (and only _one_ object).  \n",
    "For each connection, TCP buffers must be allocated and TCP variables must be kept in both the client and server; possibly significant burden on server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern browsers can open multiple (5 to 10) TCP connections in _parallel_, and each connection handles one request-response transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Round-trip time** (**RTT**): time it takes for a small packet to travel from client to server and then back to client.  \n",
    "This time includes: packet-propagation delays, packet queuing delays, and packet-processing delays.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Three-way handshake\":\n",
    "\n",
    "1. One RTT to initiate TCP connection\n",
    "2. One RTT for HTTP request and first few bytes of HTTP response to return\n",
    "3. Message transmission time\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Non-persistent HTTP response time} = 2 \\text{RTT} + \\text{message transmission time}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### HTTP with Persistent Connections\n",
    "\n",
    "Server leaves TCP connection open after sending response.  \n",
    "_Subsequent_ requests and responses between the same client and server sent over the _same_ open connection.\n",

    "**Pipelining**: requests for objects made back-to-back, without waiting for replies to pending requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "TCP connection closed after a configurable timeout interval.\n",
