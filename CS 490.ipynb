    "### Client/Server Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Splits computer workload between the service requester (client) and service provider (server),\n",
    "\n",
    "* Most popular since the 90s, gradually moving from LAN-based to Internet-based and web-based\n",
    "* Subject to the _law of diminishing return_\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: how to split the workload?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Host-Based Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "a.k.a. **Master-slave architecture**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mainframe + dumb terminals over privately owned LAN, now over the Internet as well\n",
    "\n",
    "Most popular in the 60s, 70s, and early 80s.  \n",
    "Still used today in legacy systems (and banks).  \n",
    "Gradually replaced by _thin client_!\n",
    "\n",
    "The client is the terminal.  \n",
    "Server is the mainframe computer; has presentation logic, application logic, data access logic, and data storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Thin Client Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to [host-based architecture](#Host-Based-Architecture), except that the client can be any device (not just dumb-terminal) and the server can be any machine (not just mainframe).\n",
    "\n",
    "The client is a computing device.  \n",
    "The server can be a microcomputer or mainframe; has the same logics as the mainframe in host-based architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Thin Client\n",
    "\n",
    "In a thin-client model, all of the application processing and data management is carried out on the server.  \n",
    "The client simply runs the presentation software.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is often used with legacy systems are migrated to client server architectures.  \n",
    "The legacy system acts as a server in its own right with a graphical interface implemented on a client.\n",
    "\n",
    "A major disadvantage is that it places heavy processing load on the both the server and the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fat Client Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Used to be called client-based, popular in the late 80s.  \n",
    "Earliest form of client/server but server is only a data/file server, over privately owned LAN.\n",
    "\n",
    "The software on the client implements the application logic and the interactions with the system user.\n",
    "\n",
    "The client is a computing device; has presentation logic, application logic, and data access logic.  \n",
    "The server is either a microcomputer or mainframe; only has data storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Fat Client\n",
    "\n",
    "More processing is delegated to the client as the application processing is locally executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most suitable for new C/S systems where the capabilities of the client system are known in advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "More complex than a thin client model especially for management.  \n",
    "New versions of the application have to be installed on all clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3-Tier Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "In a 3-tier, each layer executes on a separate machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "The client (computing device) has presentation logic.  \n",
    "The application server (microcomputer or mainframe) has application logic.  \n",
    "The database server (microcomputer or mainframe) has data access logic and data storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### N-Tier Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The client (computing device) has presentation logic.  \n",
    "The web server (microcomputer or mainframe) has application logic.  \n",
    "The application server (microcomputer or mainframe) also has application logic.  \n",
    "The database server (microcomputer or mainframe) has data access logic and data storage.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Large system decomposition into subsystems; layers and partitions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Layer**: subsystem that provides subsystem services to a higher layers (level of abstraction)\n",
    "\n",
    "* A layer can only depend on lower layers\n",
    "* A layer has no knowledge of higher layers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Partition**: divide a system into several independent (or weakly-coupled) subsystems that provide services on the same level of abstraction.\n",
